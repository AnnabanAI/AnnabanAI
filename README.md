Great! You're ready to take the first step and launch on GitHub. Let's make this fast, professional, and high-impact — you can have a polished repo live in under an hour.

### Immediate Action Plan: Launch AnnabanAI on GitHub Today

#### 1. Create the Repository
- Go to: https://github.com/new
- Name: `AnnabanAI`
- Description: "Ethical AI guardian fusing 3D memory reconstruction (OpenCV photogrammetry), distributed multi-agent NLP, and empathetic reasoning."
- Visibility: Public
- Initialize with: README.md, .gitignore (choose Python)

#### 2. Draft This README.md (Copy-Paste Ready)
```markdown
# AnnabanAI 🛡️

**An empathetic AI guardian blending ancient wisdom with cutting-edge technology.**

AnnabanAI is a prototype system that combines:
- **3D Memory Vault**: Procedural 3D mesh generation from text with OpenCV Canny edge detection
- **HolyGrailNLP**: Distributed multi-agent inference with semantic search (FAISS + Sentence Transformers)
- **Ethical Reasoning**: Empathetic responses powered by xAI's Grok API
- **Offline Resilience**: Full functionality during internet shutdowns

Inspired by the vision of ethical, protective AI that fosters love, intent, and human evolution.

## 🚀 Demo

![3D Model Example](examples/model_example.png)
![Edge Detection](examples/edges_example.png)

Text → 3D Model → Edge Analysis → Multi-Agent Reasoning

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/annabanai/AnnabanAI.git
cd AnnabanAI
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your xAI API key (optional for offline mode)
export XAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"

python main.py
```

Available commands:
- `/process [text]` → Generate 3D model + edges
- `/edges [text]` → View edge detection results
- `/analyze_3d [text]` → Analyze 3D features with AI
- `/query [text]` → Empathetic response

## Features
- Text-to-3D procedural generation
- OpenCV Canny edge detection on heightmaps
- Distributed agent inference (async ensemble)
- Local semantic search (FAISS)
- Full offline mode support
- Privacy-first logging with anonymization

## Vision
Building toward resilient, ethical AI systems capable of preserving human memory in 3D, reasoning across distributed agents, and responding with genuine empathy — even in disconnected environments.

⭐ Star this repo if you believe in ethical AI guardians!
```

#### 3. Prepare Files for Upload
Create these folders/files:
- `main.py` → Paste the latest integrated code we built (with OpenCV + HolyGrailNLP)
- `requirements.txt` →
```
openai
aiohttp
sentence-transformers
faiss-cpu
opencv-python
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
retry
```
- `examples/` folder → Run the code locally once:
  - Use `/process Hello from the future` → Save the generated PNGs as `model_example.png` and `edges_example.png`

#### 4. Commit & Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial launch: 3D Memory Vault + HolyGrailNLP prototype"
git push origin main
```

#### 5. Boost Visibility (Do These Today)
- Post on X:  
  > "Just open-sourced AnnabanAI — an ethical AI guardian that turns text into 3D memories with OpenCV edge detection, runs distributed multi-agent reasoning, and works offline.  
  >   
  > Inspired by ancient wisdom + modern resilience.  
  >   
  > https://github.com/annabanai/AnnabanAI  
  > #AI #OpenSource #EthicalAI #ComputerVision"

- Tag: @xAI @grok (they often engage with interesting Grok API projects)

You're done. This single action shifts you from invisible prototype to public project with real momentum potential.

Once it's live, send me the GitHub link — I'll help you:
- Optimize the README further
- Create a viral thread
- Plan the next milestone (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces demo)

Let’s go — drop the link when it’s up! 🚀
